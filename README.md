Plots configuration for mkShapes, mkPlot, mkDatacards

To be downloaded anywhere, but remember to do 'cmsenv' of the cmssw release you are using:

    git clone git@github.com:latinos/PlotsConfigurations.git
    
E.g. :

     mkShapes.py --pycfg=test/configuration.py  --inputDir=/media/data/amassiro/LatinoTrees/50ns/
    
See subfolders for detailed instructions.

The three steps are:

    mkShape: creates a root file with a lot of histograms
    
    mkPlot: merge the histograms into canvases and saves images
    
    mkDatacards: merge the histograms into a root file and a text datacard digestible by combine
